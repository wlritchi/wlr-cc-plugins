"""PostCompact hook for the notifications plugin: a compaction audit breadcrumb.

Fires just after Claude Code compacts the session context. Appends one JSONL line
per compaction recording the trigger (auto vs manual), the session id, and a
timestamp — a lightweight, greppable, per-session trail of "a compaction fired,
by this trigger, at this time" that aggregates across the fleet WITHOUT parsing
multi-hundred-MB transcripts. Its most direct use is trend data on manual /compact
load (trigger="manual") vs everything the harness compacts on its own.

What it deliberately does NOT try to capture, and why:
  - Context-size / effectiveness numbers. The exact token counts a compaction moved
    live in the transcript's own `compactMetadata` event
    ({trigger, preTokens, postTokens, durationMs}), which Claude Code finalizes
    AFTER this PostCompact hook has already run (verified empirically on 2.1.170) —
    so the hook cannot read its own compaction's metadata. Those counts remain exact
    in each session transcript and can be joined to this trail by session_id when
    precise per-event effectiveness is wanted.
  - The transcript FILE size is NOT a context-size proxy: the transcript is an
    append-only log, so it only grows across a compaction (the summary is appended).

Note on trigger for compact_session: an agent-initiated compact_session rides Claude
Code's AUTO executor, so it records trigger="auto" (NOT "manual") — the same label a
threshold auto-compaction gets. The two are told apart only by the transcript's
compactMetadata.preTokens (a self-compact fires well below the auto threshold), not
by this hook. The trigger here reliably separates MANUAL (/compact) from AUTO.

Entirely best-effort: any failure is swallowed so a compaction never fails because
of us. Fleet observability only.
