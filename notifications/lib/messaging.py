"""Pure helpers for the agent-messaging attention model (Phase B).

This module is the home of the vocabulary shared by the daemon (sender-side
loudness) and the relay shim (receiver-side attention): the intent enum, the
``ambient < direct < urgent`` level scale and the ``all < direct < urgent``
threshold scale (one shared ordinal axis), the wake-gating predicates, and the
topic-key / name-validation helpers. Nothing here touches the clock, the
filesystem, or any WebSocket — it is all referentially transparent so both sides
of the daemon/shim split can compute the same surface decision.
