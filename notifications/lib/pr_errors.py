"""Provider-agnostic PR-fetch error taxonomy, shared by every PR client.

The daemon's tracker loop recovers from fetch failures by *class* (not-found ->
terminal pr_gone; rate-limited -> defer to reset; auth -> one-time notice + long
backoff; transient -> back off and retry). Those semantics are identical whether the
PR lives on GitHub or a Gitea/Forgejo instance, so the classes live here and both
``github_client`` and ``forgejo_client`` raise them. The daemon catches these base
classes, so it stays provider-agnostic and a third provider needs no loop change.

``github_client`` keeps its historical ``GitHub*`` names as thin subclasses of these
bases (so existing imports/tests are unchanged); ``forgejo_client`` defines ``Forgejo*``
subclasses. ``PRRateLimited`` carries ``reset_at`` (epoch seconds to wait until), which
both providers populate from their rate-limit headers.

stdlib only (imported by both the asyncio daemon and the PR clients).
