"""Polling cadence for GitHub PR monitoring.

Exponential backoff: base 5 minutes, doubling after every 2 consecutive
no-update polls, capped at 8 hours. During business hours the interval is capped
to 1 hour instead. Business hours are 8am ET through 8pm PT, Monday-Friday;
since US Pacific is always 3 hours behind US Eastern, 8pm PT == 11pm ET, so the
window is exactly 08:00-23:00 in America/New_York (DST-safe). Outside business
hours, if the window opens before the next scheduled poll, the next poll is
pulled in to within ~1 hour of the open, so there is never more than a (jittered)
1-hour gap once business hours begin. Every interval is jittered.

Pure and deterministic given `now` and an injected RNG; unit-tested.
